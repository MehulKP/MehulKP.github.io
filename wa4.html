<p class='dark_mode_compatible_white'>The Office was an adaptation of a UK sitcom that showcased the daily antics of employees within an office space in a mockumentary form.
    The show proved to be a huge success both on-air and when offered on Netflix. 
    The Office has become a cult favorite for millenials and gen-z alike; however, the harsh reality is that not every season was as perfect as some fans glamorize.
</p>

<br>

<p class='dark_mode_compatible_white'>A representation of The Office's downfall over time can be extrapolated from all of 
    the <a href="https://data.world/anujjain7/the-office-imdb-ratings-dataset">episodes' IMDb ratings</a>.
    This data.world dataset of these IMDb ratings is inclusive of all of the episodes and each episode's title, rating, total votes, & original air date.
    For context, IMDb, the International Movie Database, sources its ratings from IMDb users who cast votes on a scale of 1-10 on the quality of an episode.
    The mean of such votes becomes the rating for that specific episode. The benefit of this is that the sentiments expressed are those of fans and ordinary viewers, not just a select group of critics.
    This reveals more about how people felt as a whole about each episode.

<p class='dark_mode_compatible_white'>To begin, an effecient method for determining sentiment for The Office over time is to find the <b>mean</b> IMDb rating for each season based off of each episodes respective rating.</p>

<p class='dark_mode_compatible_white'>Like most series, The Office had to <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">grow a beard</a> in the first season. It was here where The Office established its setting, characters, and tone.
    Given how foreign these elements were to audiences and the new born nature of the show, this first season had an average episode rating of 8.0 .
    Elaborating, this served as the foundation for the subsequent six seasons. Seasons 2-7 encompassed the most memorable and entertaining scenes and plot points from throughout the series' lifespan. 
    The average ratings range was between season 6's 8.2 and 8.6 for seasons 3 & 4.  
    It was during these seasons that many of the central characters saw their character arcs fulfilled.

<p class='dark_mode_compatible_white'>Moving forward, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/05/the-thing-that-made-i-the-office-i-great-is-the-same-thing-that-killed-it/275883/">diminishing returns of milking the minutia of office life</a> lead to the 
inevitable <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">seasonal rot</a> as seen by the down trend that began with the season 7 departure of one of the core characters: Michael Scott. 
From then on, The Office <a href="https://uproxx.com/tv/what-the-hell-happened-to-the-office/">unsuccessfully drifted away from focusing on the minutia of office life</a>. 
It was this reality that signified the fact that <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark">the shark had been jumped</a> as depicted with the 7.7 average rating for season 8 and the 7.9 rating for season 9.
</p>

<br>

<p class='dark_mode_compatible_white'>Although The Office was considered a top-notch sitcom during the majority of the series' duration, it inevitably had to come to an end just like all great shows before it had. 
    Its demise came from a shift in cast, writers, and novelty. 
    On the bright side, seeing the plug pulled on the series sooner rather than later helped cement its hilarious, up-lifting, and timeless reputation.
