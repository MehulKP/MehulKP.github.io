<p>Intro: The Office has become a cult favorite; however, the harsh reality is
    that not every season was perfect.
</p>
<br>
<p>A representation of The Office's downfall over time can be extrapolated from all of 
    the <a href="https://data.world/anujjain7/the-office-imdb-ratings-dataset">episodes' IMDb ratings</a>.
    This data.world dataset of these IMDb ratings is inclusive of all of the episodes and each episode's title, rating, total votes, & original air date.
    For context, IMDb, the International Movie Database, sources its ratings from IMDb users who cast votes on a scale of 1-10 on the quality of an episode.
    The mean of such votes becomes the rating for that specific episode. The benefit of this is that the sentiments expressed are those of fans and ordinary viewers, not a select group of critics.
    This reveals more about how people felt as a whole about each episode.
