<p>The unprecedented retaliation of r/WallStreetBets retail traders against Wall Street via a GameStop short squeeze of GameStop led to one of the most prolific wealth transfers in history. The equities market was never designed to function the way it did in the final week of January. As a result, government regulation is likely imminent. Having said that, the events unfolded quickly so it is worth dissecting them so that elderly senators can understand what happened and what can be done to prevent it from happening once more.</p>    

<br>
    
<p>To establish context, GameStop, a brick and mortar video game-oriented retailer, has been struggling for years, but especially so in light of the pandemic. In light of that, many institutional investors believed that it was only a matter of time that their stock price would decline in order to reflect that lack of success. Consequently, many multi-billion dollar investors (i.e., hedge funds) essentially made a financial bet that the stock price would decline. </p>
<p>A group of retail traders who gathered on an internet forum, the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, realized that Wall Street was making this bet. Matter of fact, a lot of money/influence/people were making this bet to the point where 140% of the stocks available were being bet on negatively. As a result, these retail traders banded together thinking that if they bought the stock in tandem then they could influence the stock price enough to increase based on a limited supply of stocks and such intense demand for said stocks. Doing so means that the institutional investors’ bets are losing bets because the price goes up instead of down. Furthermore, the bet they made was a special bet were since they lost now they would be forced to actually buy the stock itself like the retail traders were doing, which adds to the parabolic growth of the stock. This continued positive feedback loop of growth makes other investors who made that losing bet lose the bet to an even worse extent. This leads to a stock that is temporarily priced exponentially higher than it realistically should be and enormous volatility to the equities market.</p>
<p>However, the retail traders' plan was partially foiled when brokerages began prohibiting retail traders from buying more GameStop stock. Retail traders were forced to either hold positions or exit positions. This introduced even more volatility as people began to sell their positions. This slowed and eventually reversed the parabolic growth into a dramatic drop.</p>
    
<br>
<p>Given the events that transpired and the multiple variables that enabled this to occur, there are a number of systemic bottlenecks where reform could be introduced.</p>
<br>
    
<p>First off, brokerages imposing upon the market rights of retail traders could be addressed. Of all of the brokerages, Robinhood came out as the most infamous. Robinhood was facing a liquidity issue with clearinghouses which serve as an intermediary between them and the actual stock exchanges. Due to the sudden intense demand, these clearinghouses were requesting abnormally large amounts of money from Robinhood in order to make their customers’ transactions go through. Robinhood, however, did not have enough money available to make these unexpectedly high clearinghouse deposits. Therefore, they had to halt buy orders so that they could acquire money from investors, liquidating assets, and other means.</p>
    
<p>Consequently, policing the clearinghouses so that their rates are capped at certain thresholds would prevent brokerages from facing these types of liquidity issues.
Moreover, Robinhood was motivated to abide by the rules of the SEC-registered clearinghouses because it was more damaging to the company to violate the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules than it was to violate the trust of their retail traders. Therefore, a potential reform lies also in the SEC’s clearinghouse rules. After all, other brokers such as WeBull and TD Ameritrade followed suit and limited stock transactions partially or entirely. Whether or not they were also facing liquidity issues is unknown.</p>
    
<p>Another way to prevent "short-squeezes" is to work with the SEC and exchanges to prohibit bets (aka shorts) to be placed after a certain threshold (i.e., 90% float) so as to prevent scenarios where more than 100% of the shares available are being bet on. Doing so could dampen the parabolic effects of leveraged shorts being squeezed. In turn, this could be enough to prevent it from being possible in the first place so as to discourage retail traders from attempting it.</p>
    
<p>Moreover, approaching this matter from an angle where blame is placed on the Reddit users and the retail traders for what could be skewed as market manipulation is possible. Although for this to realistically be a point of reform then the SEC's market manipulation rules would have to be greatly modified. </p>
    
<p>Lastly, regulation could be introduced towards internet platforms that serve as town squares so as to assign policing responsibility to the platforms. However, this is a double-edged sword pertaining to what and what doesn't count as effective policing and what and what shouldn't be policed.</p>

<br>
    
<p>All in all, the GameStop "short-squeeze" reveals a lot of bottlenecks in our current equities market. Whether that be brokerages, laws, SEC regulations, retail traders, or technology platforms, there are points within this dynamic system where unanticipated implications are arising. It is worth it to deconstruct these elements in order to better understand how they interact with one another.</p>
