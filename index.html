<p>The unprecedented retaliation of r/WallStreetBets retail traders against Wall Street via a GameStop short squeeze of GameStop led to one of the most prolific wealth transfers in history. The equities market was never designed to function the way it did in the final week of January. As a result, government regulation is likely imminent. Having said that, the events unfolded quickly so it is worth dissecting them so that elderly senators can understand what happened and what can be done to prevent it from happening once more.</p>    
<br>
<p>To establish context, GameStop, a brick and mortar video game-oriented retailer, has been struggling for years, but especially so in light of the pandemic. In light of that, many institutional investors believed that it was only a matter of time that their stock price would decline in order to reflect that lack of success. Consequently, many multi-billion dollar investors (i.e., hedge funds) essentially made a financial bet that the stock price would decline. </p>
<p>A group of retail traders who gathered on an internet forum, the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, realized that Wall Street was making this bet. Matter of fact, a lot of money/influence/people were making this bet to the point where 140% of the stocks available were being bet on negatively. As a result, these retail traders banded together thinking that if they bought the stock in tandem then they could influence the stock price enough to increase based on a limited supply of stocks and such intense demand for said stocks. Doing so means that the institutional investorsâ€™ bets are losing bets because the price goes up instead of down. Furthermore, the bet they made was a special bet were since they lost now they would be forced to actually buy the stock itself like the retail traders were doing, which adds to the parabolic growth of the stock. This continued positive feedback loop of growth makes other investors who made that losing bet lose the bet to an even worse extent. This leads to a stock that is temporarily priced exponentially higher than it realistically should be and enormous volatility to the equities market.</p>
<p>However, the retail traders' plan was partially foiled when brokerages began prohibiting retail traders from buying more GameStop stock. Retail traders were forced to either hold positions or exit positions. This introduced even more volatility as people began to sell their positions. This slowed and eventually reversed the parabolic growth into a dramatic drop.</p>
